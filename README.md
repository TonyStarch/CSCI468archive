CSCI 468 archive
================

A collection of source files from my operating systems computer science course at NIU, CSCI 468. During the course students develop a light-weight operating system in assembler for the System 360 platform (currently known as System z) using a bare machine simulator program known as ASSIST V. 

Although it seems the course is no longer being taught, Dr. Rannie's page for the course can still be found at:
